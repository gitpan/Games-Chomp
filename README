BENCHMARK

  You can find bechmark.pl in the tar file that will run a few
  benchmarks and display the results. All computations are
  run from an environment where no previously calcualted states
  are but since v0.02 where we use the already know rules
  to avoid the computation of all the positions.

  There is also a file called BENCHMARK that provide some results
  I ran on my own computer which is
